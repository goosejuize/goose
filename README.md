Description: This C++ program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Vigen√®re cipher algorithm. This program provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting messages with a key provided by the user.
Programming approaches: This program utilizes functions to modularize different tasks such as encryption and decryption. This program incorporates input validation techniques to ensure that user inputs meet specific criteria. It uses loops, conditional statements, and string manipulation to validate inputs, such as checking that the message contains only letters and that the key is not longer than the message.
Instructions: Compile and run the program. Choose an option: encryption, decryption, or exit. If encrypting, enter a message and a key. If decrypting, enter an encrypted message and the corresponding key. The program will perform the encryption or decryption and display the result. Follow the on-screen prompts and instructions for further actions or to try again. Exit the program when you're done
